# dropwhale
A Drop-in Docker environment for Drupal module testing

## Purpose

Dropwhale is a drop-in Docker environment aimed at Drupal module
developers. Instead of maintaining a separate Drupal installation,
Dropwhale does all the downloading and initialization of Drupal with a
few easy commands. No need for you to download and install core. No
need to argue with xdebug or get Drush installed. It's all built in!

## Use

1. Download Dropwhale and copy the following files to the root of your module repository:
  * The .dropwhale/ directory
  * docker-compose.yml
  * dropwhale.settings.example
2. You can choose to commit the directory to your module repository, or gitignore it. Dropwhale doesn't care.
3. Rename dropwhale.settings.examples to dropwhale.settings.
4. Edit dropwhale.settings, replace your_module_name with your module machine name.
5. Make any other changes to dropwhale.settings, if desired.
6. cd to the root of your module repository. Execute .dropwhale/start.sh

If you need to rebuild from a clean version of Drupal, run .dropwhale/reset.sh
